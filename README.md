### Laptop API repo

To start the application in dev environment use

```bash
npm run dev
```

There are 4 branches in the repository

**dev** is actively being developed and is not stable

**beta** is a stable version of `dev` branch but the features are not finalized

**perf** is used for intense testing before the code is pushed to production branch

**prod** is production used code

_Note: Please use beta branch while developing frontend._

### Breaking changes

The code from dev to beta branch will be heavily modified and in most cases will have breaking changes. I'll make sure to keep them as low as possible but just in case if they are unavoidable I will mention them in the release.
